Please, a small review/and stars rating should be really appreciated :) 


						----------------------------------------
						Here is some tips, how to setup etc... :
						----------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------
First to do (before importing package) : IMPORTANT
--------------------------------------------------

- Create a new project.
- You need to configure your project (build settings) "GAMMA" to "LINEAR".
- Import the creepy cat kit.
- Delete the default camera.
- Add a character "FPSController" into the scene.


-----------------
Light & rendering
-----------------

Install the package Post Processing from the unity package manager window.

-----------------
About the doors :
-----------------

You need to make this, if you get problems with open/close procedure :

In unity search all gameobjects named (without cote): 

"Door_A » (put them to static off) 
"Door_B » (put them to static off) 

This operation allow you to get the door opening, but! If you you want to lightmap/bake
you need to redo the same operation (search) and static them again!

I know it's a pain in the ass, but i don't make the rules :)

-----------------------------------
About the f.. missing object :)
-----------------------------------

It's a rule, a kit can't fit 100% of your needs for your game... Creating a kit is not 
really easy.

In fact, when i start? And when i finish it? For this reason, i try to get informations
from my customer's, and the pack content is a bit the result of many anger mails that i
receive:) 

"The pack suxx, i need a squared shield! »
"I want a storm sword! » 
"There is a missing object, lava field »

Etc etc etc... You need to know one thing, there is alway a missing object in a kit :)
And you need to work to create a game, a bit :) A kit is a starting base....

That's why this kit contains a reduced number of textures, to allow your graphic designer 
to understand his philosophy.A good graphic designer will be able to use the existing 
textures set, to map new objects.

Many objects are mapped with the diffuse one :)

------------------------------
Texture batching for your need
------------------------------

You can customize the textures :) Updates are planed, be carreful with diffuse with big
black background, it is possible that i'm adding some shits on.
